main3.m -  compares error before and after removal of least significant attributes

main.m -  plots training and testing average mean squared error * 0.5 vs lambda

main1.m - 
	=plots training and testing minimum average mean squared error * 0.5 vs training fraction
	=plots the traning fraction vs the lambda where minimum
average squared values are obtained


main2.m- plots predicted value against actual value for training and testing data
